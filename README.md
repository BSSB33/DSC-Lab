The Paper can be found here [Paper](https://github.com/BSSB33/DSC-Lab/blob/main/Data_Science_Lab___Paper_2021.pdf)

Abstract: The paper describes a brute force method, to see how effective oversampling methods are to calculate the importance of each feature using subsets of features. 
This way we can check whether a featureâ€™s importance will change dramatically if we remove an other one.
During the process we will measure how the scores of each subset will change, and we will see a custom evaluation of importance changes. The final target of the paper is to see, how similar results can we get as an original feature importance set of a Random Forest Classifier...
